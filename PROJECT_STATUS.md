✅ What’s actually implemented (concrete / useful)
The repo is a very complete scaffold with many modules already coded at an architectural level. Concretely implemented items:
Project structure, config, scripts, and packaging:
requirements.txt, setup.sh, configs/main_config.yaml, configs/deepspeed_stage2.json.
CLI scripts: scripts/train.py, scripts/edit_video.py.
setup.py and basic dev tooling references.
Core code modules and wiring:
src/core/hybrid_ai.py — core HybridVideoAI class, save_checkpoint() / from_checkpoint() present.
src/core/orchestrator.py — component registration and orchestration skeleton.
src/core/cli.py — CLI wrapper that exposes train/edit commands to the user.
src/training/trainer.py — MultiModalTrainer class & bootstrapping for multi-phase training.
src/distillation/distiller.py — Distillation loop with attention/feature matching losses implemented (student vs teacher workflow present).
src/models/*:
multimodal_fusion.py — fusion module (cross-attention, learned weights, temporal attention).
video_understanding.py — temporal transformer + scene/motion/narrative outputs.
editing_planner.py — editing-token prediction heads (cut/transition/effect predictors).
expert_models.py — container for teacher models (structure present).
src/editing/timeline_generator.py — class exists with decode_timeline() and render_video() methods (currently simple placeholders).
src/perception/vision_processor.py & src/audio/audio_processor.py — processors exist with load_video() / load_audio() methods (placeholders).
Utilities: src/utils/* (config loader, logging, distillation utils, metrics, data loader skeleton).
src/learning/rlhf_trainer.py present (skeleton for RLHF).
Distillation & training scaffolding:
Distillation utilities, KL / feature matching, some attention-matching code exists.
Trainer orchestrates multiple phases (pretrain, distill, finetune, rlhf) and calls the distillation module.
In short: the architecture and many algorithmic pieces are coded — not just placeholders for classes; real functions like attention-based distillation and fusion logic are present.


⚠️ What is missing / currently placeholder or incomplete
Even though many modules are present, key functional pieces required to run an end-to-end system are missing or stubbed. Important gaps:
1) Teacher / expert model integration
src/models/expert_models.py is a placeholder. Although distiller.py calls self.expert_models.rtdetr(...), hq_sam(...), whisper(...), there is no code that loads real RT-DETR, HQ-SAM, Whisper, BeatNet, Demucs, etc.
There are no .from_pretrained() calls or Hugging Face model ids — teachers are not downloaded/instantiated.
2) Pretrained / student model loading
The code imports AutoModel, AutoTokenizer, WhisperModel, LlamaForCausalLM, CLIPVisionModel in places, but I did not find explicit .from_pretrained() usage or actual weight-loading for the hybrid student model. Model initialization needs concrete base checkpoints.
3) Data pipeline & datasets
src/utils/data_loader.py / dataset handling are skeletons — no real dataset readers for WebVid, Kinetics, AMV/TikTok edit corpora.
No prepared dataset files are included and no example small dataset or unit tests to run locally.
4) Vision/audio preprocessing outputs are None
VisionProcessor.load_video() returns {'frames': None, 'fps':..., 'duration': ...} — it’s a placeholder that does not return torch tensors.
AudioProcessor.load_audio() likewise returns features: None.
This blocks both training and inference.
5) Timeline rendering / final output
TimelineGenerator.render_video() is placeholder and returns "output_video.mp4" with no actual FFmpeg/MoviePy calls or GPU rendering.
No rendering backend integration (no actual calls to ffmpeg/moviepy, or to diffusion-based overlay generators).
6) RLHF / reward model / preference optimization
src/learning/rlhf_trainer.py is a skeleton — no reward model, no PPO/DPO implementation, no human feedback dataset integration, and no VBench scoring integration.
7) Expert teacher distillation loop relies on non-existent teachers
distiller.py expects teacher outputs, but without ExpertModels implemented, distillation cannot run.
8) Lack of small end-to-end smoke tests or example notebooks
No minimal example that runs with dummy data (e.g., process a 1-second clip end-to-end) so you can validate pipeline locally on a laptop/GPU.
9) No pretrained checkpoints (empty checkpoints/) and no cached model download logic
The code provides checkpoint save/load logic but there are no baseline checkpoints packaged.
10) Limited or no model export/efficient inference support
No inference optimizations (quantization, QLoRA/LoRA hooks are referenced in requirements but not wired end-to-end).
No MoE (DeepSeek/Mixtral) instantiation code — the repo uses a single hybrid model class but not the recommended MoE backbone by default.


Files I specifically inspected and the status
(Short file-by-file — what is implemented vs what to add)
src/core/hybrid_ai.py — implemented core class with interface methods (autonomous_edit, generate_editing_timeline, checkpoint saving). Missing: concrete from_pretrained calls & actual internal model initialization that loads real base models.
src/core/orchestrator.py — implemented component registry and pipeline orchestration functions. Works at skeleton level.
src/core/cli.py — implemented CLI wrappers that call training and editing flows. Will run but will early-exit unless real implementations exist.
src/models/multimodal_fusion.py — implemented fusion module (real code: cross-attention, learned weights, temporal attention). This is one of the more finished modules.
src/models/video_understanding.py — implemented temporal transformer and classifiers.
src/models/editing_planner.py — implemented heads that predict timeline tokens; however the mapping from tokens→render operations is not implemented (i.e., no token dictionaries or rendering mapping).
src/models/expert_models.py — placeholder. Must implement teacher loaders and inference wrappers.
src/distillation/distiller.py — substantial implementation for distillation losses and training loops, but depends on ExpertModels (teacher) and a student that has to be properly instantiated.
src/training/trainer.py — skeleton training orchestration; loops are present but will fail due to missing data, missing teacher models, or missing model weights.
src/perception/vision_processor.py — placeholder: returns frames: None.
src/audio/audio_processor.py — placeholder: returns features: None.
src/editing/timeline_generator.py — placeholder: decode_timeline() / render_video() return mock outputs.
src/learning/rlhf_trainer.py — skeleton with no PPO/DPO/RewardModel wiring.
scripts/train.py / scripts/edit_video.py — wrappers that wire the pipeline; they will run but only to the extent underlying components are implemented.
