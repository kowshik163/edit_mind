How to Make the Code Executable in One Run

The project is already designed to support this with the TrainingOrchestrator. To make it fully work, you need to:

Complete training_orchestrator.py: This file is the key. It is intended to be the master script that calls all other components in the correct order. You need to fill in the placeholder sections to ensure it correctly sequences the downloading, pre-training, distillation, and fine-tuning phases.

Create a Single Master Script: Create a new script, for example run_full_pipeline.py, that does the following:

Initializes the TrainingOrchestrator.

Calls the full_setup_and_train method from the orchestrator.

This method should, in turn, handle everything: call the ModelDownloader, then the DatasetDownloader, and finally, execute each training phase in the correct sequence as defined in trainer.py.

Use the Existing CLI: You can also extend the existing CLI in cli.py by adding a new command like auto-editor full-run that triggers the TrainingOrchestrator to execute the entire pipeline.

Files with Placeholders and Required Improvements

Based on the project status files and a code audit, many key modules are incomplete. Here are the files that need to be fixed and the specific improvements required:

src/learning/rlhf_trainer.py:

Placeholders: The core PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) logic for policy updates is not fully implemented and contains placeholder comments.

Improvement: This is the highest priority. You need to implement a stable reinforcement learning loop. The best approach is to integrate a library like Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning). This will provide a robust implementation of PPO and save you from having to write complex, error-prone code from scratch. You also need to build a functional system for collecting and processing human preferences, which is currently simulated.

src/distillation/distiller.py:

Placeholders: The methods for distilling knowledge from expert models (e.g., for vision, audio, and motion) are defined but lack the actual implementation for feature extraction and loss calculation.

Improvement: You need to write the code that loads the "teacher" models, processes data through them to get the expert outputs, and then computes a distillation loss against the "student" model's outputs. The utility functions in src/utils/distillation_utils.py are a good starting point for this.

src/core/hybrid_ai.py:

Placeholders: While the model architecture is defined, the autonomous_edit method is a high-level placeholder.

Improvement: This method needs to be fully implemented to orchestrate the entire inference pipeline: loading the video and audio, processing them through the respective modules, generating an editing plan with the core language model, and then sending that plan to the timeline_generator for rendering.

src/perception/vision_processor.py and src/audio/audio_processor.py:

Placeholders: These files have some logic but are missing integration with more advanced models for object detection (like RT-DETR) and audio analysis (like BeatNet), as described in the project's vision.

Improvement: You should add the code to load and use these more advanced expert models to provide richer data for the AI's decision-making process.

src/training/training_orchestrator.py:

Placeholders: This file is designed to run the entire pipeline from a single command but contains placeholders for the main execution logic.

Improvement: You need to complete the full_setup_and_train method to correctly call the model downloader, dataset downloader, and the multi-phase trainer in the right sequence, with proper error handling at each step.

Dataset Requirements

To train an AI of this complexity, you need massive and diverse datasets.

Expected Amount: For a foundation model like this, you should aim for petabytes of data.

Video: Tens of thousands of hours of video footage. Datasets like WebVid-10M (which has over 10 million video-text pairs) are the right scale.

Audio: Hundreds of thousands of hours of audio. AudioSet is a great starting point with over 2 million clips.

Preference Data: For the RLHF phase, you'll need at least 10,000+ preference pairs (e.g., "I prefer edit A over edit B") to effectively train the reward model.

Expected Kinds of Datasets:

Video-Text Pairs: Videos with descriptive captions (e.g., WebVid-10M, HowTo100M). These are essential for teaching the model the fundamental connection between visual content and language.

Temporally Annotated Video: Videos where actions and scenes are labeled with start and end times (e.g., ActivityNet). This is crucial for teaching the AI about pacing and where to make cuts.

Annotated Audio: Datasets with labeled audio events (e.g., AudioSet) to teach the AI to recognize sounds like music, speech, or applause and use them to inform editing decisions.

"Before and After" Editing Data: This is the most valuable but hardest to find. You need datasets that show raw footage and the final, professionally edited version. This directly teaches the AI what constitutes a good edit.

Editing Tutorials and Conversations: Text data from film editing books, forums (like Reddit's r/editors), and transcripts from YouTube tutorials can be used to train the language model on the theory and vocabulary of professional editing.

Finding "Before and After" and Tutorial Datasets:

Anatomy of Video Editing (AVE): This is an academic dataset that decomposes movie scenes into shots and annotates them with cinematography properties. It's excellent for learning professional editing patterns.

V3C1 Dataset: A large-scale video-to-text dataset that can be used for learning video descriptions.

YouTube Tutorial Transcripts: You can use speech-to-text models to transcribe popular video editing tutorials on channels like Premiere Gal, Justin Odisho, or specific AMV editing guides. This will provide the AI with textual data on editing techniques.

Kaggle Datasets: Searching Kaggle for "video editing" or "bloopers" can yield smaller, specialized datasets that are useful for specific tasks like identifying bad takes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Self-Coding: This is a more advanced feature, enabled by using a code-generation LLM like CodeLLaMA as the reasoning brain. The idea is that if the AI decides it needs an effect that isn't in its pre-defined library (e.g., a unique glitch transition), it could theoretically write the FFmpeg command or even a Python script to create that effect on the fly. The current implementation doesn't have this fully wired up, but the choice of model makes it possible. To implement this, you would need to:

Fine-tune CodeLLaMA on a dataset of video effect scripts.

Add a module that can safely execute the generated code in a sandboxed environment
